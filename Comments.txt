General Comments:
================================
-Place all constant variables in a separate class like Configuration or Util class. DONE
Only exception for Language related constants, you can place them in Language class.

-Write comments to explain what you are doing. I think Evan is already writing them in Java-doc format.

-Write the author comment

Game Management Related Comments (Evan):
=========================================
-I remember that you developed the language feature. In your language file, use the following format
variable name = variable value
For example:
WELCOME_MESSAGE = Welcome to Phase 10
NEW_GAME_WINDOW_TITLE = New Phase 10 Game

And the variable names should be same in different language files DONE


-Use the built-in Color class in Card class instead of representing colors with numbers, e.g., Color.BLUE. This way is more elegant. DONE


  


=========================================
GUI Comments (Matthew): 
=========================================
-Put images folder under project folder as you (or Evan) did with "lang" folder, not under a package (under src)

-Use constant variables that are defined in a separate class, e.g., Util, for the sizes of the windows, font names, titles of windows, names of buttons, text of labels, and more.
Maybe for Language related constants you can create another class Language to differentiate them from other constant variables. 
That will be very helpful to develop the Language support feature
 
-The initials of the class names should be capitalized, e.g. pdListener should be PdListener

-Define the available languages in Util class, i.e., put the following line in Util.java or Language.java
String[] languages = new String[] {"English", "Spanish", "French", "German"}


-Instead of that line
public static final String DEFAULT_LANG = "lang/en.txt";

use different variables for the path to language folder and filenames
public static final String LANGUAGE_DIRECTORY = "lang/";
public static final String ENGLISH_LANG = "en.txt";
......
 
 

=========================================
Player Comments (Paul): 
=========================================
-Create a package for player classes, e.g., phase10.player, and put Player related classes under this package to separate them from game logic. DONE
For AI player you create a package ai under player package, i.e., phase10.player.ai.

-I don't know how you will introduce the difficulty levels to user but use a simple representation, e.g., beginner, intermediate, advance. DONE
